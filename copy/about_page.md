###Why do Christians believe the Bible is God speaking?


Christians are sometimes accused of circular reasoning or ‘begging the question’ when it comes to the authority of the Bible. They’re said to believe that, ‘the Bible is the Word of God because the Bible says it is the Word of God’. Apart from this simple assertion, Christians are said to have no other justification for believing the Bible’s words are divine. But there is far more nuance and reason involved.
 
Essentially Christians believe that the Bible is impressive and reliable history. They see a coherency and integrity in the biblical data that leads them to base their life around its message.
 
The first part of the Bible, the Old Testament, contains a rich history of prophets claiming to speak God’s words over millennia. There is a growing expectation amongst these prophets that one day; the greatest prophet of all will come, not only as everlasting King, but one who is God himself. When Jesus came he affirmed the authenticity and message of these Old Testament prophets, claiming to be this great prophet. 
 
Christians take seriously Jesus’s promise that he would designate eyewitnesses of his words and miracles as messengers to spread His offer of salvation to the ends of the world. Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would remind these witnesses of all that he said during his earthly ministry. 
 
The New Testament, or second part of the Bible, is a result of this promise. It is a record of Jesus’s life and ministry written by eyewitnesses and their contemporaries. Because the history and expectation of the Old Testament is fulfilled so clearly in the New Testament, Christians see God at work. So, it’s certainly not just the claim of the Bible to be authoritative that leads Christians to believe in its message. Rather it is the character, quality and integrity of its witness. Quite simply, the Bible’s record of events has the ring of truth about it. But why not see for yourself? Start reading a gospel in the New Testament. Marks’s gospel is the shortest.
